! Class aimsessay Error: You should not use \\ in normal text. If you want 
(aimsessay)              to separate two paragraphs, just leave an empty line 
(aimsessay)              in your code. Otherwise, why would you want a new 
(aimsessay)              line? Basically, only use \\ in your title, in 
(aimsessay)              tables, in matrices, and in aligned equations..

! Class aimsessay Error: You should not use \\ in normal text. If you want 
(aimsessay)              to separate two paragraphs, just leave an empty line 
(aimsessay)              in your code. Otherwise, why would you want a new 
(aimsessay)              line? Basically, only use \\ in your title, in 
(aimsessay)              tables, in matrices, and in aligned equations..
