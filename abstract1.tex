Detecting outliers in datasets has been important in many domains. There are various Machine Learning methods which have been developed to detect outliers. Two of them are Local Outlier Factor and One Class Support Vector Machine.

The purpose of this research is to compare Local Outlier Factor and One Class Support Vector Machines models in order to find the better performing algorithm in a highly unbalanced dataset. The dataset was taken from the Kaggle data science repository. Specifically, a fraudulent credit card dataset was used to evaluate the models.

Evaluation of these models is based on True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate. Comparing results of the algorithms shows that One Class Support Vector Machine performs better than Local Outlier Factor in the given dataset.
