Detecting outliers in datasets is crucial in many domains. While in many cases outliers are considered a nuisance in the dataset, other times they actually contain important information. There are various
Machine Learning methods which have been developed to detect outliers, including Local Outlier Factor and One Class Support Vector Machine.

The purpose of this research is to compare Local Outlier Factor and One Class Support Vector Machines models in order to find the better performing algorithm in a highly unbalanced dataset. The dataset was taken from the Kaggle data science repository. Specifically, a fraudulent credit card dataset was used to evaluate the models.
Evaluation of these models is based on True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate. Comparing results of the algorithms shows that the One Class Support Vector Machine model performs better than the Local Outlier Factor model in the given dataset.
