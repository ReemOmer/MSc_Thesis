\chapter{Local Outlier Factor} \label{LOF} \label{Local_Outlier_Factor}
It is one of the density based outlier detection methods \citep{Silvia}. The idea of the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) method is to assign a probability for each object/observation of being an outlier \citep{Markus}. The outlier factor is local because it takes into account only the neighbors of each observation, therefore, it doesn't require comparing observations with the global data distribution \citep{LOF}. Figure ~\ref{LOF-MD2} shows the basic idea of LOF of a point with densities of its neighbors.

 \end{figure}
 
The LOF of an observation is based on one parameter $k$, which is the number of nearest neighbors that were considered to the observation \citep{Markus}. Developing the LOF method requires some notations and definitions which will be described in this section. Consider $p,q,o$ as observations in the dataset; the distance between observation $p$ and $q$ is given by $d(p,q)$. Whereas $C$ denote a cluster and $D$ is a dataset, then $d(p,C)=\min\{d(p,q),q\in C\}$ \citep{Knorr}.

\begin{defn}[Global Outlier in dataset $D$] \label{LOF1} An observation $p$ in a dataset $D$ is a Distance-based$(pct,k)$-outlier if at least a percentage ($pct$) of the observations in $D$ lies larger than distance $k$ from $p$ \citep{Markus}.
\end{defn}
Definition~\ref{LOF1} captures only some of the outliers (global outliers) which are far from the clusters of the dataset. However, in some datasets the interest lies in the observations that are outliers relative to their local neighbourhoods with respect to neighbourhood densities (local outliers). LOF method use a previous concepts to assign degrees to observations of being outlying, unlike other algorithms that use a binary property, therefore, the observation is either normal point or an outlier.
\begin{defn}[$k$-Distance of an object $p$] \label{LOF2} For any positive $k$, $k-distance(p)$ is defined as the distance $d(p,o)$ between $p$ and an object $o \in D$ such that:
\begin{align}
\label{a}
\begin{gathered}
\text{for at least $k$ objects } o' \in D \setminus \{p\} \text{ it holds that } d(p,o') \leq d(p,o), \\ \text{for at least $k-1$ objects } o' \in D \setminus \{p\} \text{ it holds that } d(p,o') < d(p,o).
\end{gathered} 
\end{align}
In this step the distance that is the farthest to $k$ observations that near to $p$ is defined \citep{Markus}.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[$k$-Distance Neighbourhood of an object $p$] \label{LOF3} The $k$-distance neighbourhood is the $k$-distance of $p$ neighbors \citep{Markus}.
\begin{align}
\label{b}
N_{k}(p) = \lbrace q \in D \ \{p\} | d(p,q) \leq k-distance(p) \rbrace
\end{align}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Reachability Distance of an Object $p$ with respect to object $o$] \label{LOF4} The reachability distance is the distance between $p$ and $o$ but at least the $k$-distance($o$) \citep{LOF}.
\begin{align}
\label{c}
reach-dist_k(p,o) = \max \lbrace k-distance(o),d(p,o) \rbrace
\end{align}
The reachability distance step~\ref{LOF4} is used to smooth statistical fluctuations \citep{Markus}; and it is a replacement for Euclidean distance. If the Euclidean distance between the two points is very small, the following steps will give a bias ratio of distance. Therefore, the LOF algorithm uses reachability distance instead \citep{Mathew}. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Local Reachability Density of an object $p$] \label{LOF5} It is an inverse of the average reachability distance of an object $p$ from its neighbours of $p$ \citep{LOF}:
\begin{align}
\label{d}
lrd(p) = 1/ \bigg( \frac{\sum_{o \in N_{k}(p)} reach-dist_{k}(p,o)}{|N_{k}(p)|} \bigg)  
\end{align}
In Figure~\ref{reach_dist} the reachability distance of the observation of $p_1$ is different than the reachability distance of observation $p_2$, because $p_2$ is not one of the $k$-nearest neighbour of $o$.
\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/reach_dist}
\caption{Reachability density ($k$=3) of two points $p_1$ and $p_2$ w.r.t. point $o$ \citep{LOF}.}
\label{reach_dist} 
\end{figure}
\end{defn} 
If the summation of reachability distances is 0, then the local density tends to infinity ($\infty$), which can only happens if there are two or more observations that share the same spatial coordinates \citep{Markus}.

\begin{defn}[Local Outlier Factor for an object $p$] \label{LOF6}
This step compares the local reachability density of an observation with the local reachability density of its neighbours, which captures the degree to which $p$ is called an outlier \citep{Hongyin}. The higher the value of LOF, the more likely it is to be an outlier, in other words, if density around $p$ is lower than density around $p$’s neighbors, then $p$ is an outlier \citep{Markus}.
\begin{align}
\label{e}
LOF_{k}(p) = \frac{\sum_{o \in N_{k}(p)}\frac{lrd_{k}(o)}{lrd_{k}(p)}} {|N_{k}(p)|}
\end{align}
\end{defn}

\section{Properties of LOF}
\subsection{LOF for Observations Deep in a Cluster} The LOF value for the observations that is in the cluster $C$ is approximately equal to 1, indicating that they shouldn't be labeled as outliers.
\begin{lem}
\label{lem1}
\citep{Markus} Let $C$ be a collection of observations. 
Let the minimum reachability distance and the maximum reachability distance of observations in $C$ be $\min \lbrace reach-dist(p,q)|p,q \in C \rbrace$ and $\max \lbrace reach-dist(p,q)|p,q \in C \rbrace$ respectively. Let $\epsilon$ be defined as $min-reach-dist/max-reach-dist-1$. Then for all observations $p \in C$ it holds:
\begin{align}
1/(1+\epsilon) \leq LOF(p) \leq (1+\epsilon)
\end{align}
such that:
\begin{align}
\forall N_k(p):N_k(p) \in C \\
\forall N_k(q):N_k(q) \in C
\end{align}
\begin{comment}
(i) all the $k$-nearest neighbors q of p are in C, and
(ii) all the $k$-nearest neighbors o of q are also in C,
it holds that 1/(1 + ε) ≤ LOF(p) ≤ (1 + ε).
\end{comment}
\end{lem}
Consider a tight cluster $C$, the $\epsilon$ value in Lemma~\ref{lem1} can be quite small for deep observations $p$, thus it forces the LOF of $p$ to be close to 1 \citep{Markus}.
\subsection{Upper and Lower Bound on LOF}
Lemma~\ref{lem1} shows that the LOF value for the deep observations is approximately equal to 1. The observations outside and in the border of the cluster $C$; as well as upper and lower bound of the LOF value should be obtained by using Theorem~\ref{thm1} which requires the following terms \citep{Markus}:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Minimum reachability distance between $p$ and $k$-nearest neighbour of $p$ is}
\begin{align}
direct_{min}(p) = min \lbrace reach-dist(p,q) | q \in N_{k}(p) \rbrace
\end{align}
\item{Maximum reachability distance between $p$ and $k$-nearest neighbour of $p$ is}
\begin{align}
direct_{max}(p) = max \lbrace reach-dist(p,q) | q \in N_{k}(p) \rbrace
\end{align}
\item{Minimum reachability distance between $q$ and $k$-nearest neighbour of $q$ is}
\begin{align}
indirect_{min}(p) = min \lbrace reach-dist(q,o) | q \in N_{k}(p) \text{ and } o \in N_{k}(q) \rbrace
\end{align}
\item{Maximum reachability distance between $q$ and $k$-nearest neighbour of $q$ is}
\begin{align}
indirect_{max}(p) = max \lbrace reach-dist(q,o) | q \in N_{k}(p) \text{ and } o \in N_{k}(q) \rbrace
\end{align}
\end{itemize}
\begin{thm}\label{thm1}
Let $p$ be an observation from the dataset $D$, and $1 \leq k \leq |D|$ \citep{Markus}:
\begin{align}
\frac{direct_{min}(p)}{indirect_{max}(p)} \leq LOF(p) \leq \frac{direct_{max}(p)}{indirect_{min}(p)}
\end{align}
\end{thm}
Theorem~\ref{thm1} is a function of the reachability distances in $p$ that is in direct neighbourhood relative to those in $p$ that is in indirect neighbourhood. It could be applied to all the observations $p$ in the dataset $D$ and it can give tighter bounds for deep observations than Lemma~\ref{lem1} does, and this because Theorem~\ref{thm1} is based on $k$-nearest neighbours, unlike Lemma~\ref{lem1} which is based on minimum and maximum reachability distances \citep{Markus}.
\subsection{Bounds Tightness} Tightness of the bounds depends on the nature of the point under consideration. It defines the difference is between the LOF upper and lower bounds. If there is a fluctuation of the average reachability distance in the direct and indirect neighbourhoods that is small, then the bounds are tight. But if the observation $p$ has neighbours in multiple clusters having different densities, then the bounds are not tight \citep{Markus}.
\subsection{impact of $k$ on LOF} The value of LOF is affected by the parameter $k$, but $k$ has unpredictable impact on LOF, and this results in problems. However, there is a heuristic method determines bounds for $k$, that helps to avoid the previous weakness. The method proposed by Markus M. Breunig and others \citep{Markus}.
